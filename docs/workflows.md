## Using the Chromium waterfall


### Trigger existing tests

This is basically what a non-Windows-using developer would use to verify that their code doesn't break some enterprise use case.



1.  Hack hack hack.
1.  `git cl upload`
1.  `git cl try -B luci.chrome.enterprise -b win`
1.  Wait for results to show up on Gerrit.


### Trigger existing tests using locally built binary

Expected to be used by someone who has built their binary on Windows and would like to quickly run a test case or two in the lab.



1.  Hack hack hack.
1.  Build binaries locally.
1.  `mb.py isolate out/win-foo system_tests`
1.  `isolate.py archive -i out/win-foo/system_tests.isolate -s out/win-foo/system_tests.isolated`
1.  `swarming.py â€¦` or some other script to trigger builds.


## Using a private lab

TODO(asanka): Fill these out


### Creating a private lab


### Adding "permanent" fixtures


### Interactive development and debugging

Once they run into problems and printf is no longer their friend, it's perhaps time to login to a user VM and debug their binary. Shuttling of debug symbols is TBD.

This may also be used by a developer who hasn't written a system level test yet and would just like to manually verify that the fix works.


1.  Hack hack hack.
1.  Build binaries locally.
1.  `mb.py isolate out/win-foo enterprise_system_tests`
1.  `isolate.py archive -i out/win-foo/enterprise_system_tests.isolate -s out/win-foo/enterprise_system_tests.isolated`
1.  On VM: `isolateserver.py download -s <hash>`
1.  On VM: Run and debug binary manually.
