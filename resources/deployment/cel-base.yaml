# CEL toolchain is not responble for creating the hosting GCP project. The user
# has to create the project. The toolchain assumes that the operator is an
# owner of the project. Many of the steps below will fail if the operator does
# not possess sufficient permissions over the target project.

# NOTE: In case you missed it the first time, this file will be evaluated as a
# Golang text/template. It is not a Jinja file.

  # TODO(asanka): Move the Cloud KMS management here once the Deployment
  # Manager supports CloudKMS objects. We can easily create a service account
  # directly, but this file is here to act as a template for moving more
  # resources types into a deployment manifest as the DM capabilities evolve.
